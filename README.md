# Analyzing Future Water Availability in Dehradun City

This repository contains the highlights and findings of the Undergraduate Research Project focusing on water availability in Dehradun under changing climatic and anthropogenic conditions.

## Project Objective

The study aims to analyze and predict water availability in Dehradun city by addressing:
1. The impacts of rapid urbanization and climate change on hydrological cycles.
2. Variations in precipitation patterns and their influence on water resources.
3. Development of insights to support sustainable water management.

## Key Findings

### Observed Climate (1950-2020):
- **Precipitation Trends:** Annual precipitation has shown a decreasing trend, with a marked increase in drought frequency in recent decades.
- **Flood and Drought Analysis:** Significant rise in the frequency of anomalous precipitation events and drought years between 1986-2020 compared to 1951-1985.

### Near Future Climate (2041-2070):
- **Projected Precipitation:** Expected to increase across various scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, etc.).
- **Flood Risks:** Higher frequency of extreme precipitation events anticipated, increasing flood risks.
- **Drought Risks:** Projected decrease in drought years due to enhanced precipitation.

### Far Future Climate (2071-2100):
- **Projected Precipitation:** Expected to increase across various scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, etc.).
- **Flood Risks:** Higher frequency of extreme precipitation events anticipated, increasing flood risks.
- **Drought Risks:** Projected decrease in drought years due to enhanced precipitation.

## Prospects and Applications

- **Urban Planning:** Insights can aid urban planners in designing water infrastructure resilient to climate variability.
- **Policy Making:** Recommendations for policies focusing on sustainable water management.
- **Adaptation Strategies:** Improved risk mitigation for floods and droughts in Dehradun.
